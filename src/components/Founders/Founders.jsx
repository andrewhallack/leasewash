                Najib runs a car wash and learned something from his experience: people want a clean car and they want convenience even more. A great car wash can still lose customers to a busy schedule, so it only makes sense that the same level of professional care of a car wash could be brought to an apartment complex.

                Andrew got involved in this service after reflecting on his own needs. He tends to have a packed schedule, juggling a 9-to-5 job, errands, figuring out how to get his daily exercise, and managing a social life. When realizing that others go through the same, he couldnâ€™t say no to the opportunity to get involved with Lease Wash Co. It became clear that washing a car no longer needs to be an afterthought, but something that is already taken care of.
